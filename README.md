# go-analyst
Run arbitrary queries on a remote SQL-speaking database from a simple web UI.  Save the results of your queries, pass them around via URLs.

__This is an alpha release__.  Currently you'll need to set up your own local database and write queries to match it.  Error handling is minimal.

## Platforms
Linux, OSX, Windows.  Should be ARM-capable.

## Database engines
Postgres and SQLite for now, should handle MySQL (and hopefully MS SQL) soon enough.
